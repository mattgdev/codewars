Why should we hire you?

I am very reliable. When I was stationed in California, We had a sergeant who was the barracks manager got busted for fraternizing with two jr. Marines and using drugs in restricted rooms. It was because of that situation that our company First Sergeant who is basically 3rd in command had to pick a Marine that was mature, reliable, and had high integrity to not abuse the responsibility as the barracks manager. So he chose me and I fulfilled my duty until I was sent to a special forces entry evaluation.   

What is you greatest strength?

My greatest strength is that I am constantly trying to make myself and my environment better. When I was the Logistics Non Commission Officer in California, my job was to make sure that all of the equipment for our shop was accounted for, was not missing any pieces, was clean, and worked properly. Sometimes we had Marines from other shops come in to get gear from us but some times the jr. Marines who knew were all of the gear was weren't there to help. It was because that, that I oriented the gear layout to where it was more intuitive to find gear. I also created a spreadsheet that identified where each piece of gear was and posted it around the shop so our marines could help the other find gear even if they didn't initially know where it was.   

What is your greatest weakness?

My greatest weakness is that I am a very up tight person in the work place until I feel that I have the respect of my peers and supervisors which for me happens when I feel like I am contributing to my team and the company.
